Github

![](helloworld.png?raw=true)

## Usage
1. First, create an empty repo on Github.
2. Run: `gh_create_msg.py USERNAME REPO MESSAGE`

   (Note that this will create a repository in your current directory.)

   Make sure to quote the message if it has spaces. Currently, only letters and spaces are supported.
3. Enjoy!

## To remove (or create new message)
Simply delete the repo on Github. That's it!
